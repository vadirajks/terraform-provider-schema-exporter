      description: 'etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a backup channel from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the ''etag'' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupChannel updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to backupChannels.get, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to backupChannels.patch or backupChannels.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.'
