The following are the valid actions: * allow: allow access to target. * deny(STATUS): deny access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified. Valid values for STATUS are 403, 404, and 502. * rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set. * redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR. * throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions.

If not available, the key type defaults to ALL. * USER_IP: The IP address of the originating client, which is resolved based on "userIpRequestHeaders" configured with the security policy. If there is no "userIpRequestHeaders" configuration or an IP address cannot be resolved from it, the key type defaults to IP. Possible values: ["ALL", "IP", "HTTP_HEADER", "XFF_IP", "HTTP_COOKIE", "HTTP_PATH", "SNI", "REGION_CODE", "TLS_JA3_FINGERPRINT", "TLS_JA4_FINGERPRINT", "USER_IP"]'
