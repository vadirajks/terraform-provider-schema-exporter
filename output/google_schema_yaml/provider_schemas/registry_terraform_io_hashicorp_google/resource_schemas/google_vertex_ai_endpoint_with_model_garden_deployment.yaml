                  description: Specifies the command that runs when the container starts. This overrides the container's [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint). Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a Docker 'ENTRYPOINT''s "exec" form, not its "shell" form. If you do not specify this field, then the container's 'ENTRYPOINT' runs, in conjunction with the args field or the container's ['CMD'](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd), if either exists. If this field is not specified and the container does not have an 'ENTRYPOINT', then refer to the Docker documentation about [how 'CMD' and 'ENTRYPOINT' interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact). If you specify this field, then you can also specify the 'args' field to provide additional arguments for this command. However, if you specify this field, then the container's 'CMD' is ignored. See the [Kubernetes documentation about how the 'command' and 'args' fields interact with a container's 'ENTRYPOINT' and 'CMD'](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes). In this field, you can reference [environment variables set by Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables) and environment variables set in the env field. You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax:$(VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with '$$'; for example:$$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the 'command' field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).
