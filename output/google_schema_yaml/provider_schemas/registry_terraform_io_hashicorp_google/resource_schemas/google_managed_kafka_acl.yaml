      description: 'The ID to use for the acl, which will become the final component of the acl''s name. The structure of ''aclId'' defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type, resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. ''aclId'' is structured like one of the following: For acls on the cluster: ''cluster'' For acls on a single resource within the cluster: ''topic/{resource_name}'' ''consumerGroup/{resource_name}'' ''transactionalId/{resource_name}'' For acls on all resources that match a prefix: ''topicPrefixed/{resource_name}'' ''consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name}'' ''transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}'' For acls on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal ''*''''): ''allTopics'' (represents ''topic/*'') ''allConsumerGroups'' (represents ''consumerGroup/*'') ''allTransactionalIds'' (represents ''transactionalId/*'').'

A terminal ''T'' character in the etag indicates that the AclEntries were truncated due to repeated field limits.'
