    server_tls_policy:
      type: string
      description: A URL referring to a networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy resource that describes how the proxy should authenticate inbound traffic. serverTlsPolicy only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. For details which ServerTlsPolicy resources are accepted with INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and which with EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED loadBalancingScheme consult ServerTlsPolicy documentation. If left blank, communications are not encrypted. If you remove this field from your configuration at the same time as deleting or recreating a referenced ServerTlsPolicy resource, you will receive a resourceInUseByAnotherResource error. Use lifecycle.create_before_destroy within the ServerTlsPolicy resource to avoid this.
