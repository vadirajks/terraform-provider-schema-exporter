The keys in 'public_keys' are checked first. You may specify no more than one Google-managed public key. If you specify 'public_keys', you must specify at least one (1) key and may specify up to three (3) keys. Ed25519 public keys are not secret, and only allow Google to validate a request was signed by your corresponding private key. Ensure that the private key is kept secret, and that only authorized users can add public keys to a keyset.

The recommended secret size depends on the signature algorithm you are using. * If you are using HMAC-SHA1, we suggest 20-byte secrets. * If you are using HMAC-SHA256, we suggest 32-byte secrets. See RFC 2104, Section 3 for more details on these recommendations.

The keys in 'public_keys' are checked first.
