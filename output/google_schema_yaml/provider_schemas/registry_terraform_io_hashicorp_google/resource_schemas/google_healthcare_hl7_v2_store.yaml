For example, send_date < "2017-01-02". * sendTime, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, sendTime < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00". * sendFacility, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, sendFacility = "ABC". * PatientId(value, type), which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, PatientId("123456", "MRN"). * labels.x, a string value of the label with key x as set using the Message.labels map. For example, labels."priority"="high".
