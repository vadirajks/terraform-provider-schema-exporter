            description: This field will contain the service account email address that this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account the IAM role needed to read attestations from the noteReference in Container Analysis (containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer). This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but callers should not make any other assumptions about the service account email; future versions may use an email based on a different naming pattern.

            description: The resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the user. If the Note is in a different project from the Attestor, it should be specified in the format 'projects/*/notes/*' (or the legacy 'providers/*/notes/*'). This field may not be updated. An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image and that links to this Note.

When using this field, id should be left blank. The BinAuthz API handlers will calculate the ID and fill it in automatically. BinAuthz computes this ID as the OpenPGP RFC4880 V4 fingerprint, represented as upper-case hex. If id is provided by the caller, it will be overwritten by the API-calculated ID.

Additional restrictions on this field can be imposed based on which public key type is encapsulated. See the documentation on publicKey cases below for details.
