    filter:
      type: string
      description: 'Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update events of findings. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR has higher precedence than AND. Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the corresponding resource. The supported operators are: * = for all value types. * \>, <, >=, <= for integer values. * :, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals true and false without quotes. See [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications) for information on how to write a filter.'
