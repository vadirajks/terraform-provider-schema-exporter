      description: The firewall policy of the resource. This field can be updated to refer to a different Firewall Policy, which will create a new association from that new firewall policy with the flag to override the existing attachmentTarget's policy association. **Note** Due to potential risks with this operation it is *highly* recommended to use the 'create_before_destroy' life cycle option on your exisiting firewall policy so as to prevent a situation where your attachment target has no associated policy.
