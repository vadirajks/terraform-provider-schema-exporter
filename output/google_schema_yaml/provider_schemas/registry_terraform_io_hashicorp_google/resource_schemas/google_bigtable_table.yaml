      description: Defines the row key schema of a table. To create or update a table with a row key schema, specify this argument. Note that in-place update is not supported, and any in-place modification to the schema will lead to failure. To update a schema, please clear it (by omitting the field), and update the resource again with a new schema.\n The schema must be a valid JSON encoded string representing a Type's struct protobuf message. Note that for bytes sequence (like delimited_bytes.delimiter) the delimiter must be base64 encoded. For example, if you want to set a delimiter to a single byte character "#", it should be set to "Iw==", which is the base64 encoding of the byte sequence "#".

To _create_ a table with automated backup disabled, either omit the automated_backup_policy argument, or set both Retention Period and Frequency properties to "0". To disable automated backup on an _existing_ table that has automated backup enabled, set _both_ Retention Period and Frequency properties to "0". When updating an existing table, to modify the Retention Period or Frequency properties of the resource's automated backup policy, set the respective property to a non-zero value. If the automated_backup_policy argument is not provided in the configuration on update, the resource's automated backup policy will _not_ be modified.
