      description: 'The deadline for job attempts. If the request handler does not respond by this deadline then the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED failure. The failed attempt can be viewed in execution logs. Cloud Scheduler will retry the job according to the RetryConfig. The allowed duration for this deadline is: * For HTTP targets, between 15 seconds and 30 minutes. * For App Engine HTTP targets, between 15 seconds and 24 hours. * **Note**: For PubSub targets, this field is ignored - setting it will introduce an unresolvable diff. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by ''s''. Example: "3.5s"'
