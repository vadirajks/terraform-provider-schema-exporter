      description: A list of CIDR block IP subnetwork specification. May be IPv4 or IPv6. Note that for a CIDR IP address block, the specified IP address portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example, "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly, for IPv6, "2001:db8::/32" is accepted whereas "2001:db8::1/32" is not. The originating IP of a request must be in one of the listed subnets in order for this Condition to be true. If empty, all IP addresses are allowed.
