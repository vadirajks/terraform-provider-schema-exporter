      description: 'etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a restore channel from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the ''etag'' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform RestoreChannel updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to restoreChannels.get, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to restoreChannels.patch or restoreChannels.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.'
