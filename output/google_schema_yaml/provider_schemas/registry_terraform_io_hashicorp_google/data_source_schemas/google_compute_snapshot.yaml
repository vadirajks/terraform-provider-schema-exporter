    chain_name:
      type: string
      description: Creates the new snapshot in the snapshot chain labeled with the specified name. The chain name must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. This is an uncommon option only for advanced service owners who needs to create separate snapshot chains, for example, for chargeback tracking.  When you describe your snapshot resource, this field is visible only if it has a non-empty value.

      description: Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied encryption key. After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For example, you must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the encrypted snapshot in a future request. Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the snapshot. If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot, then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
