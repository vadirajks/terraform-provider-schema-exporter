This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration, latest_ready_revison, trafficStatuses, and uri will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: traffic and trafficStatuses, observedGeneration and generation, latestReadyRevision and latestCreatedRevision. If reconciliation failed, trafficStatuses, observedGeneration, and latestReadyRevision will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created WorkerPools.
