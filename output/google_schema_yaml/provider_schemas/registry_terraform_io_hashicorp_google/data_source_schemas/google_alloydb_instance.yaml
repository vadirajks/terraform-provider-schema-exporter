      description: '''Specifies whether an instance needs to spin up. Once the instance is active, the activation policy can be updated to the ''NEVER'' to stop the instance. Likewise, the activation policy can be updated to ''ALWAYS'' to start the instance. There are restrictions around when an instance can/cannot be activated (for example, a read pool instance should be stopped before stopping primary etc.). Please refer to the API documentation for more details. Possible values are: ''ACTIVATION_POLICY_UNSPECIFIED'', ''ALWAYS'', ''NEVER''.'' Possible values: ["ACTIVATION_POLICY_UNSPECIFIED", "ALWAYS", "NEVER"]'
