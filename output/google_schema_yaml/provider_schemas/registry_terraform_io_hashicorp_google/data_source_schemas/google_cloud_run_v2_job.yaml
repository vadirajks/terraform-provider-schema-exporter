While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution, will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the state matches the Job, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: observedGeneration and generation, latest_succeeded_execution and latestCreatedExecution. If reconciliation failed, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution will have the state of the last succeeded execution or empty for newly created Job.
