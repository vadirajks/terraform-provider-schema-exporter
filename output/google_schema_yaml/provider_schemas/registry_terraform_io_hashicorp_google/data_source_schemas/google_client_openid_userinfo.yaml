  description: Get OpenID userinfo about the credentials used with the Google provider, specifically the email. This datasource enables you to export the email of the account you've authenticated the provider with; this can be used alongside data.google_client_config's access_token to perform OpenID Connect authentication with GKE and configure an RBAC role for the email used. ~> This resource will only work as expected if the provider is configured to use the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email scope! You will receive an error otherwise. The provider uses this scope by default.
